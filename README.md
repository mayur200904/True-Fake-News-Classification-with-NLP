# True-Fake-News-Classification-with-NLP
This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify news articles as either true or fake. It leverages a deep learning approach, combining advanced word embeddings with a sophisticated recurrent neural network to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between authentic and fabricated content.
